# Welcome to üêú Formiz
React **forms with easy validation and multi steps**

![Tests Badge](https://github.com/ivan-dalmet/formiz/workflows/Formiz%20Test/badge.svg)

#### üßô‚Äç **Multi steps forms**
Multi steps form logic available out of the box! No more pain to build perfect UX for complex forms.

#### ‚úÖ **Easy form validation**
Create forms in React with full validation without the pain. Turn everything into a custom field with full validation!

#### üêõ **No more logic duplication**
Don't duplicate your logic between display and validation. Validation is enabled only if the field is displayed.

#### üíÖ **Forms with your own UX**
Choose how to render validations, form buttons, and navigation between steps (wizard, tabs, other). It's your choice!

#### ‚öõÔ∏è **Built with hooks**
Use hooks & cut the complexity to create custom fields :) Use complex logic without even thinking of it.

#### üì± **React Native compatible**
You can use it with React Native. Just use the `as={View}` property on `<FormizStep>` component to replace the `div`.

## Concept

The idea behind **Formiz** is to allow you to build advanced forms with
**multiple steps, complex validations** and a **good UX** without pain.

The main idea is to build fields as independent reusable components.
**Fields can be anything**, not just inputs. Once you have built your fields,
you can use them everywhere.

When you use a field built with Formiz, you can apply validations rules on it.
**Only the mounted fields will apply their validation** to the current step and to the form.

```jsx
// Example
<MyField
  name="email"
  type="email"
  required="Email is required"
  validations={[
    {
      rule: isEmail(),
      message: 'Not a valid email',
    }
  ]}
/>
```

**Formiz core** does not provide any styles, so you can **use it with any UI library and style you want**.
Use it with [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), [ReactStrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/), [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) or your own styles.

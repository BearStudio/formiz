## Repeater State

### name

<Type type="string" />

### connect

Allow you to connect your repeater to a form.

### initialValues

<Type type="unknown[] | undefined" />

Allow you to pass some initial values to the form. If a collection field is mounted, it will lookup into this value to set his initial value.
If you don't manually connect to a form you don't need to pass initialValues, there will be automatically set.

# useFormFields

This hook allows you to retrieve the state of each fields of a form.

## Import

```tsx
import { useFormFields } from "@formiz/core";
```

## Basic usage

```tsx
const fields = useFormFields();
```

## Usage at top level

To use this hook at the top level, you need to `connect` it to the form.

```tsx
const form = useForm();
const fields = useFormFields({
  connect: form,
});

<Formiz form={form}>
{/* your fields here */}
</Formiz>
```

Then, you'll be able to access to your fields states.

## Get only some fields

Allows you to filter your fields by name(s) that you want to fetch.

```tsx
const someFields = useFormFields({ fields: ["firstName", "lastName"] });
```

You can use `nested.field` or `array[0].nested` syntaxes.

```tsx
const someFields = useFormFields({
  fields: [
    "personalInfo.firstName",
    "personalInfo.lastName",
    "books[0].name",
    "books[0].editor",
  ],
});
```

## Get only some state

Allows you to filter which states fields by state.

```tsx
const fieldsIsValid = useFormFields({ selector: (field) => field.isValid });

const fieldsValues = useFormFields({ selector: (field) => field.value });
```

This way, you can avoid re-rendering the form if a state you don't need updates, and lessen the strain on the page.

```tsx
const fieldsCustom = useFormFields({
  selector: (field) =>
    field.isSubmitted && field.value === "julie" ? "OK" : "KO",
});
```

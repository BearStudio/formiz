# useFormFields

## Basic usage

This hook allows you to retrieve the state of each fields of a form.

```tsx
const fields = useFormFields();
```

## Usage at top level

To use this hook at the top level, you need to connect it to the form.

```tsx
const form = useForm();

<MyComponent form={form}>
  const fields = useFormFields({
    connect: form,
  });
</MyComponent>
```

Then, you'll be able to access to your fields' states.

## Get only some fields

Allow you to filter your fields by name(s) that you want to fetch.

```tsx
const someFields = useFormFields({ fields: ["firstName", "lastName"] });
```

You can use `nested.field` or `array[0].nested` syntaxes.

```tsx
const someFields = useFormFields({ fields: [
  "personalInfo.firstName",
  "personalInfo.lastName",
  "books[0].name",
  "books[0].editor",
]});
```

## Get only some state

Allow you to filter your fields by state. 

```tsx
const fieldsIsValid = useFormFields({ selector: (field) => field.isValid });

const fieldsValues = useFormFields({ selector: (field) => field.value });
```

This way, you can avoid re-rendering the form if a state you don't need updates, and lessen the strain on the page.

```tsx
const fieldsCustom = useFormFields({
  selector: (field) =>
    field.isSubmitted && field.value === "julie" ? "OK" : "KO",
});
```

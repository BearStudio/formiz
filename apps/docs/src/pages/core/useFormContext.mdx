# useFormContext

This hook works like [`useForm()`](/core/useForm), with the difference that it doesn't create a new form,
but it fetches the functions and state of the first parent form. `useFormContext()` should be used only at a form children level.

## Import

```tsx
import { useFormContext } from '@formiz/core';
```

For full API detail, refer to [`useForm()`](/core/useForm) hook documentation.

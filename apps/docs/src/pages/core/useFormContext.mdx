# useFormContext

This hook works like [`useForm()`](/core/useForm), with the difference that it doesn't create a store, but it fetches the parent form. `useFormContext()` should be used only as a form children.

## Import

```tsx
import { useFormContext } from "@formiz/core";
```

You should refer to [`useForm()`](/core/useForm) hook
